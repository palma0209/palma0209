- 👋 Hi, I’m Jacqueline Palma 👀 I am fascinated by technology. Technology has the potential to transform human lives on a scale and level not seen before in the history of mankind. I am deeply motivated by the concept that something I create today or in the future could have a profound impact on someone around the world. Everyone is capable of doing it if they have the ability and work hard enough.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning about Data Science, Cybersecurity and Computer Network. 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on establishing a common goal by providing a supportive attitude, debuting a new skill, and contributing a new idea. 📫 Feel free to reach me at jacpalma126@gmail.com
